<p>by <a href="http://twitter.com/gamerandy">Adam B. Levine</a> </p>
<p>At its core, cryptocurrency is transactional &#x2013; put another way, it is money built for giving. At no other point in history has it been so easy or inexpensive to send value via a protocol like Bitcoin to anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Early indicators professed the hopeful thought that early cryptocurrency adopters might be are more charitable than the average citizen. In practice we see that charity is a result of abundance, and when individuals feel like their future is bright, they give. When they are concerned, they do not.</p>
<p>So at the <a href="http://bitgivefoundation.org/">BitGive Foundations</a> of the world, donations are a little light as the price of Bitcoin sits at less than 50% of its all-time highs and people feel poor, under assault from the events around them.</p>
<p>Sometimes people donate, but many times they don&#x2019;t. That makes things hard to predict, and hard-to-predict fundraising makes it difficult to build long term plans or expectations.</p>
<p>Building on the foundations of transactional proofs of work, we can create a new <a href="https://wiki.counterparty.co/w/Assets">User Created Asset</a> (token) that is distributed via a Proof of Charity or Proof of Donation protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Enter CharityToken</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a charitable organization raising funds for an event or cause, and once they successfully hit their goal, we make things a little more interesting. Instead of just soliciting donations and thanking the donors, these donations fulfill the conditions (the charity successfully raising the required funds) to cause the creation of CharityTokens &#x2013; one token per dollar of donation, which are then distributed to donors from the drive because they have to be distributed somewhere. Since those are the individuals adding the most value to the situation, it makes sense for these to be the first holders of CharityTokens, just as Bitcoin miners &#x201C;do the work&#x201D; of the Bitcoin network and so receive the first bitcoins for their labor.</p>
<p>If the market price of CharityTokens goes above a dollar for whatever reason, the current market price should be used as the cost basis for new tokens created. Because this is a charitable enterprise, no more than one token should be created per dollar of new donation since the reward for participation is generally other than profit.</p>
<p>CharityTokens in their nascency are worthless &#x2013; they cost nothing to create but offer a good basis as money, with all the functionality of Bitcoin with some more added on top. Tokens are inherently transparent in their operation, every time a new one is created it is easy for anyone to see when and how many. This means individual users can trust the issuer not to play games, since there are no secrets in an open ledger environment.</p>
<p><strong>The Big Distinction</strong></p>
<p>There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies trading today, and by next year we&#x2019;ll be well into the thousands. Most coins to this point have been superficially different and structurally identical to Bitcoin, the first of the cryptocurrencies. New tokens like CharityToken will distinguish themselves through their ecosystem and distribution criteria. To possess CharityToken means you support the causes and operation of the issuing organization. This is true no matter how you acquired them.</p>
<p>Donating funds and receiving tokens back is the obvious way, you&#x2019;re adding value directly to the system and expanding the money supply without diluting the good-per-token the group is able to achieve. Unfortunately this action can only be performed while an active campaign is going on, and it&#x2019;s better for these to be spaced out so the market has time to adjust to the new tokens in circulation.</p>
<p>During these times, and really any time, an individual can support the cause by simply purchasing CharityTokens at the market rate. To the individual, this is a bit like speculation &#x2013; you are speculating that more people will want to support the charity, which will increase the demand for the token without increasing the supply, which drives the price up. This is a natural tendency in speculative markets like cryptocurrency, but here there can actually be a reason. Tokens can be the way individuals interact with the foundation, so if there&#x2019;s an event being held, tickets should be least expensive to those who already donated and thus have the tokens. Raffles should be entered, auctions held denominated in the token given to donors. This encourages people to donate now and figure out what they&#x2019;d like to do with their tokens later.</p>
<p>And of course, this isn&#x2019;t store credit &#x2013; CharityTokens can form a secondary layer of fundraising, for projects who share the values of the issuing organization but perhaps don&#x2019;t want to jump through the hoops of participation. They can instead start their own website, and market their project to the holders of CharityTokens, accept that and then be vested in the network along with other donors, able to sell their stake or pay it forward, powering their project.</p>
<p>When it comes to creating new types of value using new tokens, charity is just the beginning.</p>
