<p>by <a href="http://twitter.com/gamerandy">Adam B. Levine</a> </p>
<p>When someone starts a new coin, they&#x2019;re faced with a pretty serious problem. How do you determine who should own it first? You could keep it all for yourself, you could give it to your friends or people who post on a forum and say they&#x2019;re interested. You could sell them, or <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet">print loaded wallets</a> full of them on postcards.</p>
<p>One thing to note: a coin representing value is like a sort of language whose utility is directly proportional to the other people using it. Keeping it all to yourself might make you the world&apos;s biggest expert in a language nobody speaks.</p>
<p><strong>The Classic Proof</strong></p>
<p>The most successful coins so far have gone with the give-them-all-away approach and determined who should get them first with &#x201C;Proof of Work&#x201D; or PoW. We call this Computational Mining &#x2013; your computer or dedicated &#x201C;mining&#x201D; hardware runs an application which competitively crunches cryptographic math. This secures the network, verifies transactions and provides the infrastructure-level services that run the whole thing in a trustless and reliable person-to-person fashion.</p>
<p>In recent years, both hybrid and true Proof of Stake (PoS) alternatives like <a href="http://www.peercoin.net/">Peercoin</a> or <a href="http://www.nxtcrypto.org/">NXT</a> have emerged. These systems provide the same levels of security as PoW coins by concentrating the power in the hands of stakeholders. The more coins you have, the greater your ability to &#x201C;mine&#x201D; the coin, which powers the network and earns the lucky miner a reward.</p>
<p>Either solution will serve the need &#x2013; securely process transactions given a large enough participation in the underlying system. So, it&#x2019;s a solved problem. A Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake based coin can serve as the foundational layer for new <a href="https://wiki.counterparty.co/w/Assets">User Created Assets</a> (tokens).</p>
<p>The ability to completely customize the token means you have the ability to personalize its schedule, distribution, characteristics, and economics, not to mention the branding and marketing direction. Open Source means you get to start with the best ideas in the space and build your great innovations on top of it.</p>
<p><strong>Mining at the Higher Layers</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin is an exciting development, but less than 1% of the world understands the innovation of cryptocurrency. In the future, it will be easier to introduce new users to cryptocurrency via a token rather than Bitcoin itself, most people will enter these new ecosystems via a rewards program in one of any number of industries.</p>
<p>But mining is a powerful tool; we may not need it any more, yet the metaphor of contributing your work and redeeming value that was hidden before is worth learning from. If PoW or PoS mining is solved, there is no longer value being added to the network by the layers above.</p>
<p>Computational mining is, at its core, a competitive makework. Still, the allure of Bitcoin managed to convince tens of thousands of people around the world this was worth engaging in. Incentives are powerful things. Just as Bitcoin bootstrapped the mining armsrace, I believe we can see this same phenomenon repeat many times over again, and if we take the time we can target behaviors that scale at the per-person level rather than based on how many dollars one can spend on ASICs.</p>
<p>Value in these layers is not about processing transactions, it&#x2019;s specific to the token. In some networks, value is added through the straightforward process of investment. This is the rationale for distributing new tokens to a donor; they add value that can then be used to fuel the development.</p>
<p>Mining in the higher layers is whatever adds value to your project. If you have a community, this may be useful comments; if you are developing open source software it might be &#x201C;commits&#x201D; that are incorporated into the larger work.</p>
<p>The larger work here is what&#x2019;s important &#x2013; blockchain technologies are about consensus. Consensus used to require your peers be local, and the relationships be legally binding. In the modern world these are practical limitations we&#x2019;re no longer constrained by.</p>
<p>When something so fundamental changes, it requires a complete re-assessing of all the intractable problems faced by societies throughout history. It&#x2019;s our job to test them against the now, to see if they hold true or if progress is possible where before it was not.</p>
<p>The longer I look the more I see. It is possible now, and so we build.</p>
