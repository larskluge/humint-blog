<p><em><a href="http://dogeparty.io">Dogeparty</a> is a version of Counterparty that delivers <a href="http://counterparty.co">Counterparty.co</a> functionality to the Dogecoin blockchain. Counterparty on Bitcoin is a bit expensive, relatively slow, and very secure because Bitcoin is expensive, relatively slow and very secure.</em></p>
<p><em>XDP is the token of the Dogeparty platform, and it will be distributed either via Proof of Burn (PoB) or Proof of Charity (PoC). Either one will use DOGE, but we need the community&apos;s help to figure out what to do.</em></p>
<h2 id="ltbcoin-and-incentivizing">LTBCOIN and Incentivizing</h2>
<p>Most coins are valuable because of the network that uses them. First creating a coin and then attempting to bring in service providers who will accept it, thus giving utility to the coin (and therefore value). Here at <a href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/">LTB</a>, we&apos;ve been thinking about this a lot and recently rolled out our crypto-rewards platform, <a href="http://ltbcoin.com/">LTBCOIN</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, we reward people with LTBCOIN who make what we&apos;re doing better or more fun, and they can use it to compete with others for sponsor airtime on the Let&apos;s Talk Bitcoin! show and in the near future, the entire network of shows and blogs.</p>
<p>On July 4th we sent out our largest distribution so far - 419 registered and configured users split 1.7 million LTBC proportionally, based on their contributions. It went great, and the response has been amazing. Turns out when you give people something for &quot;free&quot;, like for something they already were doing but not being rewarded for, they really enjoy it!</p>
<p>But there is a problem.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-fees-and-speed">Dealing with Fees and Speed</h2>
<p>Because LTBCOIN is built on Counterparty, which is built on Bitcoin - Every single time we send LTBCOIN to a user (which we&apos;re doing weekly), we need to pay a bitcoin fee.</p>
<p>To perform those 419 sends cost a little over .05btc, which at current rates is worth about $31.50, or about 7 cents per person.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, that cost is fantastic when compared against any non-cryptocurrency solution. Of course, we&apos;re using artificially lower fees (with the help of the XCP devs), but that will only work until more projects start pushing volume through Counterparty.</p>
<p>And on the subject, while Bitcoin is also insanely fast when compared against conventional financial options, it turns out that there is quite a bit of variance in block times - the 10 minutes is an average but blocks sometimes are found seconds apart while other times an hour will pass without a single block.</p>
<p>Because each action, whether a send, the creation of a new token, placing an order on the decentralized exchange or using the prediction market... Every single action you perform must first be included in a bitcoin block before it actually happened. You&apos;ve never felt how slow the blockchain can be until you&apos;re waiting an hour to confirm a market order.</p>
<p>What we need is an alternative, something cheap, plentiful and fast. Turns out there are quite a few options out there that meet this need, but my favorite by far is Dogecoin.</p>
<h2 id="very-improvement">Very Improvement</h2>
<p>DOGE is an interesting token. It started as a joke that exploded in popularity and has found its place as a kind of ad-hoc charity coin. Whenever there&apos;s a need, Shibes are there ready to put their &quot;money&quot; where their mouths are.</p>
<p>Although it&apos;s not one of the more expensive tokens, DOGE has one of the largest cryptocoin communities and certainly the most vocal. If value is a language, Doge is a very commonly spoken tongue in the world of crypto.</p>
<p>So when Wendell Davis from <a href="http://hivewallet.com">Hive</a> &amp; <a href="http://humint.is">Humint</a> asked me what I thought about putting the Counterparty protocol onto the Dogecoin blockchain, I was intrigued.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin we see about 1000% variance at times, ranging from over an hour to under a minute from the 10 minute average.</p>
<p>With a 60 second block time, it&apos;s just about perfect. If Doge also has something like 1000% variance, you&apos;ve got a max time of 10 minutes and a minimum time of 10 seconds. From a user-experiance standpoint, I believe this would be orders-of-magnitudes better.</p>
<p>But the cost is where my jaw just dropped. DOGE is currently trading at around 35 satoshis each. The dust limit for Bitcoin is several thousand satoshis, so that means that if we paid even one full doge per transaction (the default fee in doge is zero), our cost for that entire .05BTC transaction would have only been .00015084, or 331 times cheaper.</p>
<h2 id="surely-there-s-a-catch">Surely There&apos;s a Catch</h2>
<p>So doge is 10x faster, more than 100x cheaper... What&apos;s the downside?</p>
<p>Block Orphans. When a miner finds a block, they race to announce it to the network and claim their prize. Faster blockchains have more orphans, so you need more confirmations in order to be certain a transaction actually happened.</p>
<p>In practice this means you can wait for 10 confirmations to be as certain as you are with one bitcoin confirmation, but the view is very different when you&apos;re talking about a Counterparty layer. Here, orphans don&apos;t really matter at all. If your order or asset etc. didn&apos;t get included in a real block, the network will keep placing it until it does so while you can&apos;t be certain something happened, you will get real and meaningful feedback in a much faster way.</p>
<p>Even with Dogecoin, the majority do not orphan, so in a normal scenario you&apos;re looking at one minute response time, and in an extremely bad scenario you&apos;re looking at perhaps a thirty minute wait time. Compared against Bitcoin it&apos;s no contest.</p>
<p>LTBCOIN is not moving to Doge... yet... But as I&apos;ve always said, LTB is focused on solutions in the new digital economy more than being a ra-ra we&apos;re all going to be rich about Bitcoin. If there is an obviously better solution to accomplish a given task, we&apos;ll use it.</p>
<p>The Dogeparty however, isn&apos;t going to wait for us. It&apos;s going to happen very soon indeed!</p>
<h2 id="introducing-dogeparty">Introducing Dogeparty</h2>
<p><a href="http://dogeparty.io">Dogeparty.io</a> is the open source Counterparty Protocol adapted and applied to the Dogecoin blockchain. That means you can easily create new crypto-assets with it, utilize a full p2p decentralized exchange, a decentralied prediction market, group chat, and one of the first multi-token wallets out there.</p>
<p>For the last several weeks the Humint team has been working  to bring this lower cost, faster service vision to fruition.</p>
<p>With Dogeparty, anybody will be be able to create a new token that rides on top of the Dogecoin blockchain, for whatever purpose they desire.</p>
<p>You could create:</p>
<ul>
<li>A crypto-rewards program like LTBCOIN</li>
<li>A charity token given out to those who donate to your cause</li>
<li>A game token that is awarded to the winners (and a little to the losers) of your challenge</li>
<li>A reputation coin that you create few of and give out only to those you trust</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you can imagine, you can do. It doesn&apos;t require mining or worrying about the security of the network. All you have to do is think of what you want to accomplish, and then use this versatile toolkit to make it real.</p>
<p>But there&apos;s one more thing we need to figure out, and for this we&apos;d really appreciate your help.</p>
<h2 id="a-token-to-power-new-tokens">A Token to Power New Tokens</h2>
<p>In order to do these advanced things, we need to create a new token. The first token, called XDP. Counterparty has XCP, and created and assigned their tokens with a process called Proof of Burn (PoB). A &quot;burn address&quot; is an address you can send crypto to, but whose private key can never be known because it is too challenging to solve.</p>
<p>Through this process, about 2.5 million XCP were created when 2,100BTC were sent to 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVrby the end of the 30 day burn period.</p>
<p>Initially I thought this was wasteful because, obviously, it would be better to have the funds with which to develop the project, but it wasn&apos;t long before I was struck by how drama-free this method is. It&apos;s so fair.</p>
<p>NXT did something similar, but the problem was lack of trust in an anonymous developer with a speculative project so participation was incredibly low, less than 100 individuals with the &quot;raise&quot; of 21 bitcoins, 1% of the XCP total.</p>
<p>This is not to denegrate NXT, merely to show the difference between participation in a project where money is being given to someone anonymous, which thus requires trust that the person won&apos;t run off with the funds, compared to money being destroyed.</p>
<p>XCP also distinguishes itself by not having any sort of founder allocation or pre-mine - The founders and developers of XCP have what they have because they burned their own bitcoins. It&apos;s a way of definitively saying we&apos;re all playing by the same rules, and if we succeed we all win, if we fail, the developers do not gain from their failure.</p>
<p>The lesson I take from this is TRUST is the important factor. The incentives, for all the parties, need to be aligned.</p>
<h2 id="another-path">Another path</h2>
<p>While PoB is fair, it actually is sort-of wasteful. Even if you&apos;re not giving them to the development team (because for example, you don&apos;t need much in terms of development funds) there are many ways it could be used to make the world a little better. As a result we&apos;ve come up with an alternative for you to consider.</p>
<p>Proof of Charity (PoC) is a &quot;burn&quot; that can still do good. To create new XDP, instead of sending your doge to an unspendable address you would send it to a multi-signature address that requires all the keyholders signing off in order to release the funds. This would not happen until after the XDP generation period is complete to prevent recycling of tokens through the system.</p>
<p>During this period, we would enlist the dogecoin community (specifically the reddit community) to help us find and vet charities who would like to participate in the Doge Proof-of-Charity, and ones that find a measure of popular support would be entitled to an equal share of the DOGE collected via this method.</p>
<p>It&apos;s important that the keyholders are diverse. Our proposal is one keyholder from the Dogecoin dev team, one upstanding community member, and someone unaffiliated with either.</p>
<p>I&apos;ll raise my hand here as the third keyholder since I&apos;ve got a lot to lose if I run off with the DOGE, but if the community has a better suggestion I would happily not have the responsibility.</p>
